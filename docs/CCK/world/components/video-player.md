# CVR Video Player

## General

##### Network Sync
Enables the network sync of the video player. This syncs the current video url and video time to others and allows
watching videos in sync with others.

##### Playback Speed
Defines how fast the video should be played.

???+ tip "Playback speed explained"  
    A playback speed of **1** equals **1 second** of video played per **1 second**. (**x1**)  
    A playback speed of **2** equals **2 second** of video played per **1 second**. (**x2**)

##### Use Interactive Library UI
Enabling this will enable our default video player ui. In order for this to work **UI Position/Parent** needs to be set.  
More information about the default ui and how to use it here: [VideoPlayer-UI](../../../ChilloutVR/).

##### UI Position/Parent
The parent of the video player ui. You can also move this object around in your scene, as the ui will be child object.  
This needs to be set inorder for the ui to work. You can use an empty game object to define its position.

##### Play On Awake Object
Can be set by clicking **Set as Play On Awake Object** on a specific video.  
Used to play this video on start or awake if no other video is playing and **Play on Startup** is enabled.
Can be removed by clicking the **Remove Play On Awake Object** button bellow.

##### Projection Texture
The [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-RenderTexture.html) which will be used to display the video output.  
We recommend using the render texture generated by the **Create Sample Render Texture**.

If needed, you can modify the render textures resolution by clicking on it in your project and changing the resolution to your needs.  
By changing the resolution you can also define the aspect ratio of the render texture.
The video play will automatically adjust to the render textures resolution and aspect ratio. This means it will fill
empty pixels with black and fit the video inside while centering it as well.



## Events
You can hook into different events, that will be triggered by the video player.

##### Started Playback
Triggered whenever a video playback started.

##### Finished Playback
Triggered whenever a video finished playing.

##### Paused Playback
Triggered whenever a video gets paused.

##### Set Url
Triggered whenever a new video url gets set.
