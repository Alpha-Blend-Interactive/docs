A game object that should be used as a fallback, if the game object defined above falls under a filter rule.


## Advanced Avatar Setting
##### Base Animator
The Base Animator is used as a base by the AAS generator. That for, its very easy to expand the base animator while 
still using the AAS system.  
As a novice user it is recommended to use the one packed with the CCK it is called ***AvatarAnimator*** located in 
***Assets/ABI.CCK/Animations*** folder, you can use your own Animator here but we suggest to use the one packed with 
the CCK unless you know what you are doing.
