    game objects in this list.

##### Fallback GO (GameObject)
A game object that should be used as a fallback, if the game object defined above falls under a filter rule.


## Advanced Avatar Setting
##### Base Animator
The Base Animator is used as a base by the AAS generator. That for, its very easy to expand the base animator while 
still using the AAS system.  
As a novice user it is recommended to use the one packed with the CCK it is called ***AvatarAnimator*** located in 
***Assets/ABI.CCK/Animations*** folder, you can use your own Animator here but we suggest to use the one packed with 
the CCK unless you know what you are doing.

animations to the new generated one automatically.
