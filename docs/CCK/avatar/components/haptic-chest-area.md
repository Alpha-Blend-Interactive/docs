# CVR Haptic Chest Area
This component allows you to configure your chest haptics area for your avatar.

The chest haptic area has 20 trigger points on both front and back side. This translates to the 40 trigger points on 
the [BHaptics Tactsuit X40](https://www.bhaptics.com/tactsuit/tactsuit-x40).
Each point will vibrate based on the intensity setting in the haptics software.  
We recommend around 20% for the intensity setting.

!!! note "Component location"  
    We recommend placing the component on its own game object to make it easier to scale, rotate and offset it to
    your desired location.
