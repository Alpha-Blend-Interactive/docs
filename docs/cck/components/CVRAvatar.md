# CVR Avatar

The CVR Avatar Component is necessary for making an avatar upload. To use this component, the GameObject must have a [Unity Animator component](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/class-Animator.html) and the [CVR Asset Info](CVR Asset Info.md) component. If these two components aren't present when the CVR Avatar component is added, they will be generated automatically.

Additionally, the CVR Avatar component includes an automatic generator for fundamental advanced avatar settings to aide in rapidly developing animators from scratch.

## Getting Started

While the process for uploading avatars is made as accessible as possible, there are still a few things that should be addressed before uploading. A more more complete and generalized guide for getting started with various assets can be found on our [Getting Started]() (add link) Page.

### Preparing a New Project

### General Information for Beginners

## UI

The CVR Avatar component has 7 sections spanning a variety of customization, setup, and safety settings. Please note that while some fields or list items can be animated, not all of them can.
### General Avatar Settings

!!! hint
	The Voice Parent and View/Voice position Auto buttons are only present if the avatar is configured for Unity's Humanoid Rig. More information on this can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingHumanoidChars.html)

The General Avatar Settings menu has 3 settings, 2 of which are split into 3 sections for the X, Y, and Z position of the view and audio source. These settings function as follows:

- View Position: The point at which the in-game viewport camera originates. This can be edited from the inspector panel, or by grabbing the move gizmo's handle on the ðŸŸ¢ (Green ball) in the scene view

- Voice Parent: Selects which bone the voice position rotates and translates with. The available options are Head, Left Hand, Right Hand, and Hips.

- Voice Position: The point at which player voice originates. This can be edited from the inspector panel, or by grabbing the move gizmo's handle on the ðŸ”´ (Red ball) in the scene view
### Avatar Customization

Settings found in this menu are necessary for additional customization and setup options found beneath it. Making sure these fields are filled for anything other than extremely generic avatars also allows for things like face and eye tracking, lip sync, and any kind of animator customization.

!!! hint "Select the Correct Animator"
	When using an animation override controller please make sure that the one you have selected has the correct animator controller applied. If not, you will either not see any animation slots at all, or incorrect ones for the avatar you're editing.

The Animation Overrides field must be occupied by a Animator Animator Controller that has the avatar's currently used Animator Controller applied to it if you would like to make use of custom animations, rename toggles or states in the Quick Menu, or use Advanced Avatar Settings.
