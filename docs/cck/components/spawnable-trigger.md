# CVR Spawnable Trigger
Spawnable Triggers are basically [CVR Advanced Avatar Trigger](aas-trigger.md) for [Spawnables](spawnable.md).
But they have a slightly different setup.

A Spawnable Trigger requires a [Spawnables](spawnable.md) component,
which can either be on the same game object or on a parent component.

### Properties
Most properties are equal to [CVR Advanced Avatar Trigger](aas-trigger.md) and are not document here.

##### Parameter
Select the parameter you want to change, this is similar to the **Setting Name** from an [CVR Advanced Avatar Trigger](aas-trigger.md).
