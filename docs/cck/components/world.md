# CVR World
This is the main component for a world and needed for uploading your world. 

### World Settings

##### Spawns
The transform position and rotation of the assigned game objects will be used as spawn points for players.
If there are no configured spawn points, the transform of the cvr world game object will be used instead.

!!! info  
    Place the spawn locations above the ground so players do not fall through or get stuck inside the ground collider.

##### Spawn Rule

+ **In Order**  
   Each new player joining the world will be selected a new spawn point in Ascending order 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. in the spawn list.
+ **Random**  
   Each new player joining the world will be selected a random spawn location from the spawn list.
