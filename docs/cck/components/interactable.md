# CVR Interactable

##### Tooltip  
A tooltip text which will be displayed when hovering over the trigger.

## Triggers
The list of triggers defined for this **Interactable**.

### Trigger
Every trigger has a type selected, which defines how it will be or can get triggered.

#### General Properties
Properties which are valid for all the different types.

##### Broadcast Type
Defines how the triggered action should be networked to other players in the instance.

+ **Local Not Networked**  
  Not Networked, execution is local only
+ **Global Networked**  
  Execution networked to all other players in the instance
+ **Global Instance Owner Only**  
  Same as **Global Networked**, but only allowed to be triggered by the current instance owner
+ **Global Networked All Instance Moderators**  
  Same as **Global Networked**, but only allowed to be triggered by all the instance moderators

!!! info "Buffered Network Types"
    The suffix Buffered means, the execution will be synced to late joiners (execution count saved on server side).
