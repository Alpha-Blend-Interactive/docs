# Setup Unity and CCK


## Downloads
As our Content Creation Kit evolves constantly, we recommend to always use the latest version. You can find information
on how to upgrade from an older version below.

##### Download CCK
First, download our cck.  
[ :fontawesome-solid-download: Download Content Creation Kit {{ cck.cck.version }}]({{ cck.cck.downloadUrl }}){ .md-button .md-button--primary }


##### Download Unity
You also need one of our supported unity versions, we recommend to use **Unity {{ cck.unity.install.version }}**

[ :fontawesome-solid-download: Unity {{ cck.unity.install.version }} (Unity Hub)]({{ cck.unity.install.hub }}){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[ :fontawesome-solid-download: Unity {{ cck.unity.install.version }} (Win-Executable)]({{ cck.unity.install.executable }}){ .md-button }

!!! warning
    CCK 1.X is not compatible with the revamped creation process of CCK 2.X - It is required to upgrade from 1.X to
    2.X in order to upload content.

## Installation

##### Removing old installations
Before importing the new version, please remove the following folders in the main directory of your Unity project if
present: "ABI.CCK" and "ABI.MODS". A restart of the editor is not required. This procedure can be optional but is recommended for line version upgrades (1.X to 2.X, 2.X to 3.X, etc.)

##### Importing new CCK
If no old CCK is present, you can just import the package found above. If you already have an older version of our CCK
imported, please refer to the information of the step above.

##### Signing in to the CCK
To sign in to the CCK, you need your content creation kit master key. You can get this key here: Community Hub Key-Manager.
You will then sign in with that key and your username.

## Publishing Content
To publish your content, regardless of type, log in to the [Community Hub](https://hub.abinteractive.net/) and navigate
to your contents details page. You can then navigate to the publication settings tab and hit on publish. This will open
a ticket for publishing. We will get back to you shortly.
