# CVR Attachment
Documentation can be found [here](old/attachment.md).

## Attach to Bone
You can attach a game object to a bone using the following setup.
This could be used to attach weapons to your back or hip.

## Attach to additional Trackers
You can also use additional Trackers to attach game objects to.
You could use this for example for tracking real items in your playspace, and showing them ingame.

## Attach to HMD
Attaching to the Main Camera/HMD of a player is also possible like this.
This can be useful in many use-cases. For example, as a map creator, having particles spawn around the player.

This should probably not exist because we make the funny in the component page itself - Lily
