## Breaking Changes

#### The [Avatar](../api/avatar-api.md) Height property was changed into a method
- Changed `Height` property to `GetHeight()` method to be in-line with the other methods

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed structs being weird
- Fixed `out` parameters not working properly
- Fixed some functions not matching existing method overloads when they should
- And many more

## New Features

### [LuaBehaviour](../api/lua-behaviour.md)
- `Script` is now available globally as a way to get a reference to the currently running
  script's [Lua Behaviour](../api/lua-behaviour.md) instance

### [Events](../api/events.md)
- Added [Player Events](../api/events.md#player-events), called when players join/leave
- Added [Avatar Events](../api/events.md#avatar-events), called player's avatar's change
- Added [Instances Events](../api/events.md#instances-events), called when the instance connection status changes
- Added [Special Execution Order Events](../api/events.md#special-execution-order-events), some events that run later
  than other monobehaviour events

### [AvatarAPI](../api/avatar-api.md)
- Added `GetInitialHeight()` method

### [PlayerAPI](../api/player-api.md)
- Merged base, local player, and remote player into a single entity to avoid weird castings. But some functionality is
  still locked to either remote/local avatars. *This does not cause any breaking changes*
- Added [IK Control](../api/player-api.md#ik-control) that allows managing the player's IK

### Examples
- Added [Viewpoint Raycast example](../examples/viewpoint-raycast.md)
