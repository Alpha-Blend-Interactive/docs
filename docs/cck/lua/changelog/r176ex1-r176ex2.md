## Breaking Changes

### IsLocal -> IsWornByMe

- **Description:** The `IsLocal` global was causing a lot of confusion. So it was renamed to `IsWornByMe`
- **Usage:**
  ```lua
  if RunningInAvatar then
      print('This script is running on an Avatar!')
      if IsWornByMe then
          print('And is being worn by me!!!')
      end
  end
  ```

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the global variable `IsSpawnedByMe`, it should now work properly on props
