## Breaking Changes

- Removed `GetBoneTransform(HumanBodyBones humanBone) : Transform` from the [AvatarAPI](../api/avatar-api.md)
  - This was introduced to be used with FinalIK elements, but we're going instead to opt to create an API to manage the
    IK properly

## Bug Fixes

- The events now check against `isActiveAndEnabled` and not only `enabled` to determine whether they should run or not

## New Features

### [Globals](../api/globals.md)

- `IsValid()` is now available as a [Global Special Function](../api/globals.md#special-functions) to properly null
  check System Objects, Unity Objects, and our API Objects Like [Player](../api/player-api.md#player)
  or [Avatar](../api/avatar-api.md#avatar)
