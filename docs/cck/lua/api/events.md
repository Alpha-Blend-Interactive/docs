## Unity

Most of Unity's MonoBehaviour events are forwarded to your Lua script. You can define these functions in your script to
handle these events.

::: note
In ChilloutVR, `UnityEngine.Time.fixedDeltaTime` is set based on the **target** refresh rate, clamped between 30hz and 144hz. This means that FixedUpdate will be called at a variable rate, but the time between calls will be consistent.
