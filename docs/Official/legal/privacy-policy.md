##### Cookies
Cookies are text files placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not

##### Public posting
If you post in the comments of a blog post on the Website (or anywhere on social media), you
should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit
to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. Alpha

Alpha Blend Interactive UG (haftungsbeschränkt) does recognize that parents, guardians, or other adults may purchase our

## (6) Managing your data

##### Understanding your rights

It is important that you understand your legal rights around your personal data and how we may use it. If you would like
to discuss or exercise any of these rights, please contact our Data Controller at office@abinteractive.net

##### Right to be informed

This Privacy Policy aims to inform you about how we process your personal data. You might also see specific messages
when we collect personal data from you that explain why we ask for it.

##### Right of access

You have the right to access a copy of your personal data and receive certain information about what the data is and how
and why we are processing it. We will ask you to prove your identity before we can disclose any information.

##### Right to erasure

You have the right to request that we delete your data. There are some circumstances where we may need to keep your
details, for example, if we are legally obliged to do so. If this is the case, we will explain and discuss these
circumstances with you.

##### Right to restrict processing

You can request that we restrict processing of your data, as an alternative to deleting it – this means that we will
keep the data but stop processing for most purposes. You may want to exercise this right if you feel that the data is
inaccurate, that our processing of it is unlawful, whilst we progress a request from you to object to processing, or if
we have no further need of the data, but you require us to keep it in relation to the establishment, exercise or defence
of a legal claim.

##### Right to data portability

You have the right to request a copy of your data, in readable form, and have us transfer it to another organization.
There are some circumstances where these rights may not apply, but where this is the case we will always explain this to
you.

##### Right to object

You have the right to object to the processing of your data.

##### Rights related to automated decision making

You have the right to avoid being subject to decisions based solely on automated processing (including profiling) which
has a significant effect on you. We do not carry out any such processing.

## (7) Data retention

We keep records of your communications with us for ten years in case we have to refer to a conversation or enquiry. This
could be because it relates to our legitimate business interests, you are still in communication with us, or for legal
reasons.

We keep your contact information on any mailing lists you chose to join unless you tell us otherwise. If you haven’t
opened one of our emails for some time, we may contact you to ask if you still want to hear from us. If you unsubscribe
from a mailing list, we retain some basic information to ensure we don’t contact you again in the future.
