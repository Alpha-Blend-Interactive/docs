§6.1 You may never forcefully enable or otherwise gain access to any feature not finished or rolled out using modifications or proxy scrips.

§6.2 You may never modify or replace your nameplate. This is done to preserve the value in separate nameplates given out to users that contributed a lot. We tolerate hiding the nameplates or doing minor modifications in explicit roleplay situations or fitting scenarios like horror worlds.

§6.3 If you hide your avatars nameplate entirely, which is allowed, you must tag your avatar with the horror tag.

§6.4 You may use all components given in the form of the content creation kit for content creation purposes only. Malicious intent will be punished.

§6.5 You may utilize all whitelisted components to their full extent as features not intended for use will be removed by the development team.

§6.7 Knowingly creating content beyond reasonable limits that is negatively impacting another users' client performance is forbidden.

§6.8 Bypassing the world publication system by placing static portals (portals that are part of the world) to non-published worlds in published worlds is forbidden. This excludes rewards for completing challenges and portals to development versions of that specific world. This rule is meant to affect different worlds, by different authors and prevent actual misuse to bypass the publication system.

§6.9 When updating content and adding features requiring a different tag, you are required to change the content tags accordingly. Content tags must match the underlying content at any time.

§7.3 Publishing obfuscated mods to the workshop is not allowed.

§7.4 If you have to overwrite, alter or include base game scripts with your mod, you have to request appropriate permission before releasing it to the public. In this case we also require you to include a disclaimer that the base code of the game is owned by us. This may be a simple one-liner.

§7.5 When releasing mods to the public, it is required to state, that the mod authors and modification are in no affiliation with ABI and not suppoorted by ABI.

§7.6 You may never create cheats / hacks to bypass limitations or gain an unfair advantage in any game mode or game world.
